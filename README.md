Hi Access Bank, I have a little account with you that has been wrongly debited twice.

Thank you for resolving the issue I had some days back where I have charged <strike>N</strike>2,000 for MTN airtime without getting the airtime. I, however, seem to have a bigger issue at hand: I have been charged twice for a single purchase I made on [Jumia](https://www.jumia.com.ng/).
