Hi [Access Bank](http://www.accessbankplc.com/), I have a little account with you that has been wrongly debited twice.

Thank you for resolving the issue I was some days back where I was charged <strike>N</strike>2,000 for MTN airtime without getting the airtime. I, however, seem to have a bigger issue at hand: I have been charged twice for a single purchase I made on [Jumia](https://www.jumia.com.ng/).

The root of this wahala is a <strike>N</strike>10,488 purchase I made on Jumia on the 3rd of December, 2017. When I checked my account balance that day I could see that my account had been debited by that amount. However, on Tuesday, December 5, 2017, I got a text message showing that my account had once again been debited by that same amount. Please follow the pictures below.

The transactions for Dec 1 (where `+` represents credit and `-` represents debit) were:
> * Opening balance = 218,998.75
> * -1,000 = 217,998.75
> * -1,000 = 216,998.75
> * +5,000 = 221,998.75

There was no financial transaction on Saturday, December 2 (as shown in the image below), so account balance was still at <strike>N</strike>221,998.75:

On Sunday, December 3, I withdrew #5,000 from an ATM. This should have brought my account balance to <strike>N</strike>216,998.75 (`221,998.75 - 5,000 = 216,998.75`), instead I had an account balance of <strike>N</strike>206,510.75 (as seen below). The only logical explanation is that Access Bank had already debited my account of the <strike>N</strike>10,488 (`216,998.75 - 10,488 = 206,510.75`).
