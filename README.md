Hi [Access Bank](http://www.accessbankplc.com/), I have a little account with you that has been wrongly debited twice.

Thank you for resolving the issue I was some days back where I was charged <strike>N</strike>2,000 for MTN airtime without getting the airtime. I, however, seem to have a bigger issue at hand: I have been charged twice for a single purchase I made on [Jumia](https://www.jumia.com.ng/).

The root of this wahala is a <strike>N</strike>10,488 purchase I made on Jumia on the 3rd of December, 2017. When I checked my account balance that day I could see that my account had been debited by that amount. However, on Tuesday, December 5, 2017, I got a text message showing that my account had once again been debited by that same amount. Please follow the pictures below.
