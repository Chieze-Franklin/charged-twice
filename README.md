Hi [Access Bank](http://www.accessbankplc.com/), I have a little account with you that has been wrongly debited twice.

Thank you for resolving the issue I was some days back where I was charged <strike>N</strike>2,000 for MTN airtime without getting the airtime. I, however, seem to have a bigger issue at hand: I have been charged twice for a single purchase I made on [Jumia](https://www.jumia.com.ng/).

The root of this wahala is a <strike>N</strike>10,488 purchase I made on Jumia on the 3rd of December, 2017. When I checked my account balance that day I could see that my account had been debited by that amount. However, on Tuesday, December 5, 2017, I got a text message showing that my account had once again been debited by that same amount. Please follow the pictures below.

The transactions for Dec 1 (where `+` represents credit and `-` represents debit) were:
> * Opening balance = 218,998.75
> * -1,000 = 217,998.75
> * -1,000 = 216,998.75
> * +5,000 = 221,998.75

There was no financial transaction on Saturday, December 2 (as shown in the image below), so account balance was still at <strike>N</strike>221,998.75:

On Sunday, December 3, I withdrew <strike>N</strike>5,000 from an ATM. This should have brought my account balance to <strike>N</strike>216,998.75 (`221,998.75 - 5,000 = 216,998.75`), instead I had an account balance of <strike>N</strike>206,510.75 (as seen below). The only logical explanation is that Access Bank had already debited my account of the <strike>N</strike>10,488 (`216,998.75 - 10,488 = 206,510.75`). Note that I got no SMS notification for the N10,488 that day.

I have a personal finance management app that also shows all the transactions discussed thus far.

On Monday December 4, I was credited with <strike>N</strike>10,000, taking my account balance to <strike>N</strike>216,510.75 (`206,510.75 + 10,000 = 216,510.75`)
> ![December 4 Update](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/franklin-chieze/Screenshot_20171205-233720.png " N10,000 credit")

On Tuesday December 5, I was credited with <strike>N</strike>2,000 (a refund from Access Bank), and charged <strike>N</strike>50 for card maintenance. My transactions were:
> * Current balance = 216,510.75
> * +1,000 = 217,510.75 `refund from Access Bank`
> * +1,000 = 218,510.75 `refund from Access Bank`
> * -50 = 218,460.75 `refund from Access Bank`

However, I was shocked when I finally got the SMS notification for the <strike>N</strike>10,488 purchase of a few
days back only to discover I had been debited <strike>N</strike>10,488 **AGAIN**, bringing my account balance to
<strike>N</strike>207,972.75 (`218,460.75 - 10,488 = 207,972.75`).

I am very worried because I feel this will happen again. There are other online payments I have made for which I
have been charged, but without receiving SMS notification. I fear that when the notification comes through I will
be charged again. Please consider the effort I have taken to prepare this (needless to say I can't be doing this everytime; it would be easier to just close this little account), and do the needful.

Please fix this, return my money, and avoid future occurence in the name of customer satisfaction.

Thank you.
